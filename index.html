    Our Village is Our Breath
  </font></h1>
    <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" >
    <p><h4>Introduction:</h4></font> Town life in our country began and developed with the beginning of the British rule. The British merchants came here with commercial goods, also set up mills and factories. They selected suitable sites for the towns and there godowns, show-rooms and houses for mills and factories.</p>

 
    <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" >
      <p><h4>Life of the village people:</h4></font> Yet village life has its glory and importance. Nearly eighty-five percent of the people of our country live in villages. They till the land and raise food for the people living in towns. The village people are simple, religious and conservative. So they are ignorant of the modern method of agriculture.</p>

      
       
      <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" ></font>
      <p><h4>Healthy climate:</h4></font> Village life has some pleasures and interests. The village provides a large area for small population. The houses there are sparse. They stand apart from one another. So the village gets plenty of air and light. The air is not poisoned by the smoke of mills and factories. Light is not prevented by the multi-storied buildings.</p>

      
       
      <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" ></font>
      <p><h4>Natural beauty:</h4></font> The village is the seat of natural beauty. The fresh breezes blow in the morning and the evening. They cool our tired body. The sky looks beautiful at sunrise and sunset. Birds sing sweetly. Trees give cool shade. Boats sail in the rivers. These are not found in towns. So people can live in the village in peace.</p>

      
       
      <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" ></font>
      <p><h4>Disadvantages:</h4></font> Village life has some disadvantages. There lives hardly any good doctor in the village. So village people have to depend upon quacks for medical treatment. There is no good road in the village. In the rainy season, village roads become muddy. There are no good arrangements for education. People living in the village are deprived of the minimum comforts of life.</p>

      
       
      <font face="Lato" color="#ffff" size="3" ></font>
      <p><h4>Conclusion:</h4></font> A village is more neat and clean than a town. Nature's beauty better smiles in the village. Greater percentage of people lives in our village.</p>
